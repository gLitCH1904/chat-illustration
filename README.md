## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- SASS(Used Visual Studio Code Live Compiler)
- Flexbox
- Desktop-first workflow
- Font=> Family:[Rubik](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Rubik)


### What I learned
I used this project to reinforce my knowledge of SASS and the use of SASS nesting. Along with my knowledge of "@keyframes" animations in CSS

To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

(code snippet of CSS animation)
```css
@keyframes moveFromRight {
  0% {
    opacity: 0;
    transform: translateX(3rem);
  }

  40% {
    transform: translateX(-1rem);
  }

  100% {
    opacity: 1;
    transform: translateX(0rem);
  }
}
```
